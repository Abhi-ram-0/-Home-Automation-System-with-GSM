# Home Automation System with GSM

## Description
This is a Home Automation System that allows controlling household appliances using SMS commands sent via a GSM module. The system uses an Arduino board, a GSM module (SIM800L/SIM900), and a relay to control home devices remotely.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or any compatible microcontroller)
- GSM Module (SIM800L/SIM900)
- Relay Module (for controlling appliances)
- Power supply for Arduino and GSM module
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino libraries: SoftwareSerial

## Installation and Setup
1. Connect the GSM module and relay to the Arduino as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the code (`home_automation_gsm.ino`) to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. Insert a SIM card with SMS functionality into the GSM module.
4. Send an SMS with the command "ON" to turn on the appliance and "OFF" to turn off the appliance.
